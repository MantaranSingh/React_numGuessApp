# 			Number Guessing Web App using React



1. The web app generates a random number between 1-100. 

2. On submit, the user will be given a response. The response will be based on the difference between the random number
generated and the userâ€™s input.

3. The user is allowed to make any number of guesses, until he finds the correct
answer.
